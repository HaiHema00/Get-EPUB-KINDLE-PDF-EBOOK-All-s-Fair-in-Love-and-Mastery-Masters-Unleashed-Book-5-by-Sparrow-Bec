One scorching night shouldn't have made things weird between them, but it changed everything. Who knew there were lines friends can't uncross? Now, no one gets under his skin and drives him wild quite like Dex. Since she refuses to wear his collar, he can only mask his desire with sarcasm and antagonism.Dex has had it up

Rating: 5.0 out of 5 stars
Title: SexComplicatesThingsWhatanUnderstatement
Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2019
Review: I‚Äôll start with this. Personal experiences are always going to color perceptions and who you relate to. For me, it meant I had a much deeper connection and emotional understanding of Grant.It also meant that, while I liked Arabella aka Dex, she frustrated me to no end bost of the way through this book.Here‚Äôs the thing...it‚Äôs always complicated when friends navigate their way to lovers. Especially best friends. You always bring your baggage and fears into the relationship. You can‚Äôt help it. So it stands to reason that sex will color, and potentially jeopardize, relationships, which is precisely where these two awesome characters found themselves.The had sex. Promised it wouldn‚Äôt change their best friendship, and then discovered there was no coming back from it. They had to navigate their new normal, but it wasn‚Äôt so easy. One of them was terrified to be in a relationship, while the other needed the relationship to feel loved, and neither would back down.So what do you do to fix it? Buy a BDSM island resort in the middle of nowhere and invite your best friend to check it out with you!What could possibly go wrong?And yes, I‚Äôd read this book, this author, and/or this series again. It was THAT good.

Review: Love the rest of the series - to the point where I've reread them a number of times. This one? Not so much. I cant stand h. H tries to set boundaries and h refuses and continues to try and manipule H to get her way. Then when H makes the slightest comment about what he wants, h says he's manipulative. What?? Her reasoning as to why she's the way she is doesn't wash either. I'm more than 50% through the book and I want nothing more to do with h but I'll finish it just because I bought it. I'll still be getting the next in the series and just hope the other characters in the future aren't such awful people.

Title: Theirloveisswooning
Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2019
Review: I just love when two people who believe they're unlovable and don't want to fall in love do. Grant is a rough sadist who believes he's unlikeable and undeserving of love. Dex is his pixie masochist who doesn't want to get hurt again so she friend zones everyone. Their push/pull is just amazeballs. Like all of Sparrow Beckett's couples, the chemistry is gripping. I love this series. The conflict of the characters and their flaws, mostly in not seeing how wonderful they are. Their love is swooning. I'm going to miss this series. I better reread it.????

Review: I loved the other books in this series. But i couldnt even bring myself to finish this one. Grant deserves way way better than that manipulative dex. I found myself hoping they wouldnt get together and when it feels like its going to happen i stopped reading. Shes really really unlikable.

Title: Exceptional
Date: Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2020
Review: Grant Ellis is at a crossroads in his life and Arabella "Dex" Dexter maybe the one person who will point him in the right direction. Best friends for years he wants something more but that something is the one thing she can't or won't give him. Taking on a new challenge he enlists Red's help in assessing the locale and needs of his new venture. A week in the Canadian wilderness gives them a different perspective on their relationship.

Review: This is the first book I‚Äôve read in this series. I couldn‚Äôt make myself finish it. I got to about 60% on my kindle and quit. I couldn‚Äôt stand the h. I didn‚Äôt care for the H very much either. The constant fighting and bickering back and forth was tiring and ruined the book in my opinion. I‚Äôm sure not going to be reading any other books in this series.

Title: Ilovedthisstory
Date: Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2019
Review: I really did love this story and I think it's fitting for the end of the series. I'll be upfront and say I've missed the second and third in this series but I will definitely read those two soon. I don't know how I ended up missing them. But it didn't take away from the stories for me. I'm in awe as to how two writers can do this with stories, but I'm so happy that they've done it so well. I had a smile on my face more than half the time I was reading. Love the characters and can really see them in real life.

Review: This has been my favorite in the series. Both characters are lovable for a change and they both have a great sense of humor to the point that I laughed out loud multiple times. And true to the author, it was HOT
